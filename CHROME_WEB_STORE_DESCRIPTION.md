## Full Description
Save money effortlessly while you shop. Woolsocks helps you activate eligible cashback and discover available gift card vouchers on participating online stores.

What it does
- Detects supported merchants as you browse
- Shows a small panel at checkout when vouchers are available
- Activates cashback with a visible countdown and cancel option
- Works without login for browsing deals; sign in to track earnings
- Clear privacy: minimal data, on-device content analysis, and full user control

How it works
1) Visit an online store. If its eligible, the extension can activate cashback after a visible prompt.
2) On checkout pages, a panel may show available vouchers and rates.
3) Manage settings from the popup: enable/disable auto-activation or reminders.

Transparency and control
- You can disable auto-activation and use reminders only.
- You can also turn off reminders entirely.
- The extension explains when a redirect will happen and lets you cancel.

Privacy
